# OpenCV Haar cascades
Python program that uses OpenCV's Haar cascades to detect faces in a webcam stream.
 * The program that loads an image and converts it to different color spaces, such as HSV and LAB.
 * Calculate and visualize the histograms of an image using OpenCV.
 * Implement histogram equalization as a class method to improve the image contrast.
 * Use object-oriented programming concepts to encapsulate the histogram calculation and equalization functionalities within the class.

Your program have the following components:

· A class ImageProcessor that encapsulates the image processing functionalities.

· The ImageProcessor class have a method calculate_histogram to calculate the histogram of the input image.

· The ImageProcessor class have a method equalize_histogram to perform histogram equalization on the input image.

· The program load an image, create an instance of the ImageProcessor class, and then use its methods to calculate and equalize the histogram.

· Visualize the original and equalized histograms using the matplotlib library.

· Display the original and equalized images side by side.

· Your program demonstrate how OOP concepts like encapsulation and class methods can be used to modularize image processing functionalities.
